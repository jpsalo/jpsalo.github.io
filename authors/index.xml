      <description>&lt;p&gt;JP is a usability enthusiast who focuses on optimizing every aspect of product development, from the end user experience to the code architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP is a programmer since 2010 and specialize in frontend development. He has solid, hands-on experience in product development for the web, backed by CS, HCI and cognitive science studies. JP strives for elegant and future-proof solutions which are both efficient and intuitive to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working at large and small companies and in projects of different scale and age has provided JP insight into team dynamics and business reasoning behind the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP believes that the people who use the product can&#39;t be an afterthoughtâ€”they shoul be at the core of the work. He understands the value of a genuine connection with the users and knows that the best result is achieved when everyone is as close to the people as possible. He enjoys being part of the early-stage prototyping with pen and paper and gets most satisfaction from building complex glitch-free UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
